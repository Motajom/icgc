  <h3>A SYMBOL OF LOVE</h3></p>
  <p>
But God demonstrates His own love towards us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8

A true story was reported of a couple that was visiting a jewellery store. As the jeweler showed them various necklaces, the woman commented, “I like these, but do you have any without this little man on them?”
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>That is what so many people want today; a cross without Jesus. They want a cross without any offence, one that will look cool with their outfits. But if we could travel back in time and see the cross in its original context, we would realize that it wasn’t a fashion icon at all. The cross was a bloody and vile symbol. It was an instrument of punishment, cruelty and death. In fact, it was a symbol of shame. </li>
   <li>The Romans chose crucifixion because it was meant to be a slow, torturous way to die. It was the means of executing those who commit first degree offences like murder and treason. It was designed to humiliate a person. Crucifixions outside the Roman cities served as warnings to anyone who would dare oppose the rule of Rome. </li>
   <li>If there was any other way, do you think that God would have allowed His Son to be crucified? If there had been any other way, we could have been forgiven, then God surely would have used it. But He did, because there was and is no other way. He had to pay the price for our sin. At the Cross, Jesus purchased the salvation of the world. </li>
   <li>If you are ever tempted to doubt God’s love for you, even for a moment, then take a long, hard look at the Cross. Nails did not hold Jesus to that cross. His love for you did. </li>
   </ul>
<br>
<br>
Prayer: Thank you, Lord Jesus, for dying on the cross for my sins. I will forever make my boast in the cross.
