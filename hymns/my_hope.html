  <p align="center"><b>Verse 1</b></p>

My hope is built on nothing less<br>
Than Jesus Christ, my righteousness;<br>
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,<br>
But wholly lean on Jesusâ€™ name.<br>

<em>On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;<br>
All other ground is sinking sand,<br>
 All other ground is sinking sand.</em><br>

When darkness veils His lovely face,<br>
I rest on His unchanging grace;<br>
In every high and stormy gale,<br>
My anchor holds within the veil.<br>

<em>On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;<br>
All other ground is sinking sand,<br>
 All other ground is sinking sand.</em><br>

His oath, His covenant, His blood,<br>
Support me in the whelming flood;<br>
When all around my soul gives way,<br>
He then is all my hope and stay.<br>

When He shall come with trumpet sound,<br>
Oh, may I then in Him be found;<br>
In Him, my righteousness, alone,<br>
Faultless to stand before the throne.<br>

<em>On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;<br>
All other ground is sinking sand,<br>
 All other ground is sinking sand.<br></em><br>
