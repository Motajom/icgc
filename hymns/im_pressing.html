I'm pressing on the upward way,<br> 
New heights I'm gaining every day; <br>
Still praying as I onward bound, <br>
"Lord, plant my feet on higher ground." <br>

<b>Chorus:</b><br>
<em>Lord, lift me up, and let me stand, <br>
By faith, on heaven's table-land, <br>
A higher plane than I have found; <br>
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. </em><br>

My heart has no desire to stay <br>
Where doubts arise and fears dismay; <br>
Tho' some may dwell where these abound, <br>
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground <br>

<b>Chorus:</b><br>
<em>Lord, lift me up, and let me stand, <br>
By faith, on heaven's table-land, <br>

Tho' Satan's darts at me are hurled; <br>
For faith has caught the joyful sound, <br>
The song of saints on higher ground. <br>

And catch a glimpse of glory-bright; <br>
But still I'll pray till Heav'n I've found, <br>
"Lord, plant my feet on higher ground." <br>
