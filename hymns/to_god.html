<p align="center">
To God be the glory, great things He hath done,<br>
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,<br>
Who yielded His life our redemption to win,<br>
And opened the life-gate that all may go in.<br>

<b>Chorus:</b><br>
<em>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,Let the earth hear His voice;<br>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,Let the people rejoice;<br>

Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,<br>
To every believer the promise of God;<br>
The vilest offender who truly believes,<br>
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives<br>

Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,<br>
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;<br>

Our wonder, our transport when Jesus we see.<br>
