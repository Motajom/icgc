Hark! the herald angels sing,<br>
"Glory to the newborn King!"<br>
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,<br>
God and sinners reconciled<br>
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,<br>
Join the triumph of the skies;<br>
With th' angelic host proclaim,<br>
"Christ is born in Bethlehem." <br>
Hark! the herald angels sing,<br>
"Glory to the newborn King!"<br>

Hail! the heav'n born Prince of peace!<br>
Hail! the Son of Righteousness!<br>

Born to raise the sons of earth,<br>
Born to give them second birth.<br>
Hark! the herald angels sing,<br>
"Glory to the newborn King!"<br>
