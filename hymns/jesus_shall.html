Jesus shall reign where’er the sun<br>
Doth his successive journeys run;<br>
His Kingdom stretch from shore to shore,<br>
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.<br>

With every morning sacrifice.<br>

Blessings abound where’er He reigns:<br> 
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains,<br>
The weary find eternal rest,<br>
And all the sons of want are blest.<br>

Let every creature rise and bring<br>
Peculiar honors to our King;<br>
Angels descend with songs again,<br>
And earth repeat the loud Amen.<br>
